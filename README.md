# HireSmart

## ðŸš€ Project Setup Guide

This project is fully containerized using Docker. Follow the steps below to get your local development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

---

### Step 1 â€” Configure Environment Variables

First, create your local environment configuration file by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the required credentials for the database and Redis. **This step is mandatory**, as Docker Compose will use these variables to initialize the services.

```ini
# .env

# API Port
API_PORT=4000

# PostgreSQL Configuration
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

# Secrets
CSRF_SECRET=supersecretcsrfsecret
SESSION_SECRET=my-session-secret
COOKIE_SECRET=my-cookie-secret

JWT_SECRET=randomstring
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=somethingwentwrong

# Feature flags
IS_CSRF_ENABLED=false
```

### Step 2 â€” Build and Run the Docker Containers

With the environment variables configured, build and start the services in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command will build the application image and start the `hire-smart-app`, PostgreSQL, and Redis containers.

### Step 3 â€” Set Up the Database

Finally, run the database migrations and seeders to set up the database schema and populate it with initial data:

```bash
docker exec -it hire-smart-app npm run setup:db
```

- **API Base URL:** `http://localhost:4000`
- **Swagger Docs:** `http://localhost:4000/api-doc` (available in development mode)

### Default Login Credentials

- **Admin:**
  - **Email:** `admin@mail.com`
  - **Password:** `defaultPass123!`
- **Employer:**

- **View profile:** Anyone can view their profile.

### Job Application (Candidate)

- **Browse Jobs:** Candidates can browse available job postings.
- **Apply for Job:** Candidates can apply for jobs that match their skills and preferences.
- **View Applications:** Candidates can view the status of their job applications.

### Job Matching and Notifications

- **Job Matching:** The system periodically matches new job postings with suitable candidates based on their skills and preferences.
- **Notifications:** Candidates receive notifications for new job matches and updates on their applications.

### Admin Functionality

- **Metric Monitoring:** Admins can view application metrics and system performance.

### Background Processes
